                <h2>Company History</h2>
                <p style="text-indent:2em;">
                    EC-CG, an acronym for "Electronic Commerce Computer Gadgets," founded by a group of tech enthusiasts
                    and entrepreneurs.
                </p>
                <p style="text-indent:2em;">
                    In its early days, EC-CG operated as a small brick-and-mortar store, catering to
                    the needs of local tech enthusiasts. It focused on providing a wide range of high-quality
                    computer components, accessories, and the latest gadgets at competitive prices. The founders
                    believed that by combining their expertise in technology with a customer-centric approach, they
                    could create a unique shopping experience for their customers.
                </p>
                <p style="text-indent:2em;">
                    As the company grew, it expanded its product range to include laptops, desktops, monitors, and other
                    IT peripherals. Over the years, EC-CG has built a strong reputation for its excellent customer
                    service, competitive prices, and reliable products.
